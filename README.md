## Issues and Solutions during development

### Set HTML id for markdown headings for page navigation

In this project I have used markdown files as my content source (src/projects). Each `.md` file contains information about a portfolio project with the same structure:

- metadata about the project in the frontmatter,
- Table of Contents with the list of topics found in the documentation and the links to them on the page using ids,
- documentation text each topic starting with an `<hr/>` tag and a header.

To give the Gatsby GraphQl layer access to the files in the filesystem I have used a source plugin, `gatsby-source-filesystem` and configured it in `gatsby-config.js`.

Using GraphQl queries I dynamically added this data to the `index.js` page and queried based on a unique slug for the project details page.

To add a Table of Contents linked to the topics I needed a dynamic id for each header generated automatically based on the text of the heading. Using the syntax provided by the official [Markdown documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#heading-ids) Gatsby failed to add the ids to the headers.

To overcome this issue I replaced each heading with a link and placed the header element inside. The `<a/>` rendered from the markdown files with this change had the ids needed.

When configuring the `jsx` generated from the markdown using the `markdown-to-jsx` npm package I could no longer add the `target="__blank"` prop to all the `<a/>` on the project details page, else the Table of Contents links would also open new pages.

To overcome this issue I used the following resources:

- [Discussion: Anchors in Markdown](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/anchors-in-markdown/247)
- [Markdown.org Documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#heading-ids)

### Gatsby and the Window object

To implement the scroll-to-top button feature on the project details page I needed to access the `window` object on the client side.

Using the `gatsby develop` command Gatsby runs in the browser. But when building the application with `gatsby build` it happens server-side, so the window object doesn't exist. This causes the build process to fail.

The `gatsby-browser.js` file "...gives you control over Gatsbyâ€™s behavior in the browser. For example, responding to a user changing routes, or calling a function when the user first opens any page."[1]

To overcome this issue:

1. I added a `gatsby-brower.js` file to the root folder.
2. Created the `class ScrollToTopBtn` which when initialized adds event listeners to the window object (which now will always exist) and the button added to the `project-details.js` template with the id of `scroll-btn`.
3. If the HTML element with the id given is present on the page, the class is initialized and the event listeners are added. All done by the exported `onRouteUpdate()` which runs when the user initially loads the page or changes routes.

The following articles and documentation helped me overcome this issue:
