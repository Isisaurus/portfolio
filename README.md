This repository is my personal portfolio website deployed to [https://diana-vitanyi.vercel.app/](https://diana-vitanyi.vercel.app/). The page contains some of my personal projects and public projects I worked on recently.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), with TypeScript and TailwindCSS v4.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
